## DESCRIPTION
This folder contains the website files for the CGA-WM organization.

## FILES

### \_site.yml
* The YAML file for designing the organization website.

### .gitignore
* The ignore file to help git skip files that shouldn't live on the repository.

### build.R
* The R script used to build the organization website.
    Built using R 3.6.2, rmarkdown 2.1, and pandoc 2.9.1.1

    `Rscript build.R`

### footer.html
* The HTML file used as a footer on each page of the organization website.

### index.html
* The HTML rendered index.Rmd file.
    It is generated by the build.R script; do not edit this file.
    It serves as the home page for the organization website.

### index.Rmd
* The R markdown version of the organization's home page.
    Edit this file to make changes to the website.
    Edits can be rendered to HTML using the `build.R` script (see above).

### README.md
* This file.

### resources-data.html
* The HTML rendered data resources page.

### resources-data.Rmd
* Edit this file to include new data resources on the organization website.

### resources-howto.html
* The HTML rendered how-to resources page.

### resources-howto.Rmd
* This script automatically searches for other .Rmd files with the prefix "resources-how-to" and adds them as a hyperlinked list.

    * __resources-how-to-hack-arcpro-python.Rmd/.html__

        Discusses the methods for accessing the Python interpreter used by ArcGIS Pro from the command line.
        There is a known issue where cloning the Python environment fails if there are spaces in the directory path (e.g., "Program Files").
        Not 100% certain, but changing the install to local user directory (C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\ArcGIS\Pro) should solve that problem.

    * __resources-how-to-spatial-join.Rmd/.html__

        A walkthrough of performing a spatial join in ArcGIS Pro.

    * __resources-how-to-tutorials.Rmd/.html__

        Links to the CGA YouTube playlists.

    * __resources-how-to-work-with-zip-files.Rmd/.html__

        Links to Manuel Gimond's working with zip files on Windows PC tutorial.

### searchjs.html
* The JavaScript functions for updating the resources-data.html site when a user types into the search bar.
    If none of the keywords (typed letters/words in the search bar) are found in either the title or description (dictionary term, dt, or definition, dd), then that element is hidden from the page.

### styles.css
* The cascading style sheet (CSS) used to create user-defined HTML styles for the organization website.

### course/
* This directory stores the course sites (e.g., Intro GIS and Advanced GIS) referenced by the organization's website.
    These course sites contain their own copies of source files for generating their websites.

### images/
* This directory contains image resources utilized by other pages (e.g., spatial join tutorial).

### site_libs/
* This folder is created by rmarkdown.
    It contains website-specific support files.
