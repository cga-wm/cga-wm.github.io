summary: "Why do we care about web GIS and what is it anyways?"
---

Check out [this article](https://mangomap.com/web-gis) by Mangoï»¿ (10 minute read).
There are a lot of good points made about why web GIS is good, but the authors ultimately point to StoryMaps as the go-to solution.

In my opinion, StoryMaps are a cute paint by numbers application where the box is clearly defined in which you can "create" your own web media.
I was partial to the older "classic" StoryMaps where you could download the application and host it on your own website.
With a little HTML and CSS know-how, you can start to take advantage of some of the stuff behind-the-scenes to make StoryMaps really your own.
For example, [this StoryMap](https://kateforrestauthor.com/story/map/2018/) I created for a travel guide.

But it doesn't take long before you realize the limitations of StoryMaps and start to see the paint-by-numbers for what it truly is.
Even now, the new StoryMap editor is beginning to look like the Shutterfly of photobooks for GIS---an over-whelming abundance of selectable options, but at the end of the day, they are still just pre-defined options.

This may be fine for those who want an off the shelf solution that masks the hidden nature of what's going on; what it means to be a web GIS.

We're in developer land.

We demand freedom.

This is what makes the web great.

There is a dark corner of Esri, called [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/), which provides some of what is sought.
I think an outstanding example to demonstrate to students is how to create maps and do something with them without ever touching StoryMaps, ArcGIS Desktop, or ArcGIS Pro.
Yes, you still need ArcGIS Online (or another REST data service), but these data services are becoming more prevalent and (hopefully) easier to use.

Okay, so what is web GIS?

You could [run a search](https://www.esri.com/en-us/search/?q=web%20gis) on Esri for "web gis" and browse the 4000+ topics, but I recommend reading [this article](https://www.gislounge.com/difference-web-gis-internet-gis/) by Majid Hojati (2014), which references the book *Web GIS: Principles and Applications* (2010) by Fu & Sun.
The article provides a nice figure that demonstrates the hierarchy of GIS, Distributed GIS, Internet GIS, and Web GIS.

For a more concrete definition, let's turn to [VizExperts](https://www.vizexperts.com/webgis):

> "WebGIS is an advanced form of Geospatial Information System (most commonly known as Geographic Information System) available on the web platform.
> The exchange of information takes place between a server and a client, where the server is a Geospatial Information System (GIS) server and the client is a web browser, mobile application and desktop application.
> The server has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) so that clients can find it on the web.
> WebGIS brings GIS into the hands of the people.
> It reduces the need to create custom application.
> It provides a platform for integrating GIS with other business systems and enables cross-organizational collaboration."

How do we break this down?

1. Web GIS is GIS accessed through the web. Great.
1. Information is exchanged between a cloud-based server (i.e., a computer connected to the internet running server software + GIS software) and a user (aka the client) that's accessing the server with a browser (such as their desktop computer, tablet or smartphone). So, it's basically like a website.
1. A unique URL is just the web address; this means it's hosted and (presumably) open to the public. Again, so it's like a website.
1. The rest is just gush.

Okay, so how do they do it?

Let's take a look at the ArcGIS for Developers site again (https://developers.arcgis.com/).
As a member of the W&M community, your account unlocks a lot of the resources available here.
Keep that in mind as you plan you future using GIS.

Navigating to the "Get Started" section of this site (https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/), we see lots of options.
Under "Find Tutorials by API or SDK" (that's Application Programming Interface or Software Developer Kit), we see the familiar Python.

Click it.

You'll see there are a variety of tutorials at your disposal for learning how to use Python in Notebooks.

Wait!
This isn't the Python blog!

Click JavaScript.

What is JavaScript?

Check out [this post](https://skillcrush.com/blog/javascript/) by Scott Morris.
Basically, if you have ever visited a website with any interactive elements, that's all due to JavaScript.

So JavaScript brings the web to life.
Great.
What about the GIS?

This is where Esri steps in.
They have JavaScript libraries that perform and provide the functionality that we are familiar with in GIS, such as creating feature layers and web maps, assigning symbology, and defining pop-ups to display attributes.

Try it out yourself!

* Create a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) account---this will let you save your projects and share them---it's optional, but helpful
* Test the [Create a starter app](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/create-a-starter-app/)
* Try your hand at some more tutorials
