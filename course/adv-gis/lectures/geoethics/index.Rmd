# Environmental Ethics

> the tradeoff between <span class="fragment highlight-green">ethical concerns</span><br />and short-term <span class="fragment highlight-green">economic benefits</span>

<p></p>

<div class="fragment">
<small><span style="color:#17ff2e">\*</span> these both relate to what we _value_ and how our values influence our actions</small>
</div>

# Values

How do we value things?

***

| VALUE | DESCRIPTION |
|--|--------|
| Use value | Something we use directly  |
| Existence value | Knowing that something exists, even if we never experience it ourselves |
| Option value | Something we might use later |
| Aesthetic value | Something of beauty or emotional appeal |
| Scientific value  | Something for research |
| Educational value | Something for teaching and learning |
| Cultural value | Something that sustains or defines a culture |

***

|  |  |
|--|--|
| __MORALS__ | __ETHICS__ |
| Personal principles with respect to right/wrong | <span class="fragment">Rules of conduct with respect to our culture</span> |
| <span class="fragment">Individual</span> | <span class="fragment">Societal</span> |
| <span class="fragment">Internal</span> | <span class="fragment">External</span> |
| <span class="fragment">Something we "believe in"</span> | <span class="fragment">Because society "says so"</span> |
| <span class="fragment">Transcendental</span> | <span class="fragment">Governed</span> |

# Ethics

> the set of morals or beliefs <span class="fragment highlight-green">of a given group</span> that guide and clarify our actions

<div class="fragment">
... so who is the group?
</div>

***

Relativists
:   each culture _should_ be allowed their own ethics

<div class="fragment">
(e.g., freedom of religion)
</div>

***

Universalists
:   there exist a single set of ethics that hold true for all cultures

<div class="fragment">
(e.g. human rights/equality)
</div>
