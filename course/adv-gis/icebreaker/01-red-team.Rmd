!["Elk Bath" (2000) by J. McColgan, Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service. Online: [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Deerfire_high_res.jpg/640px-Deerfire_high_res.jpg).](elk-bath_640x395.jpg){width=640 height=395}

Intended goals
:   - Understand the role of GIS in disaster response
    - Exercise data exploration and feature geolocating and projecting
    - Utilize distance and direction geoprocessing tools
    - Analyze maps to determine specific outcomes

**Problem Statement**

Six people are lost within the Caldor Fire in California as the fast-moving wildfire spreads out in their direction.
They are hiking the area's state and national forests as a part of an animal rescue expedition.
Five of the hikers have radioed in their locations (see **Table 1**) and the last known location of the sixth was near Frog Pond just south of Nebelhorn.

The National Aeronautics and Space Agency's Fire Information for Resource Management System ([FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)) has been helpful providing data on the latest fires in the area.

You have less than one hour to provide recommendations to the closest haven for each of the six hikers.
The hikers have no mode of transportation other than hiking.
Assume that all residences and businesses in the area have been evacuated.

You may use whatever information is available to you.
This includes GIS data from previous classes and from other web sources.
You may use ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Google Earth, or other web-based mapping service.

**Before You Begin**

1. Meet with your team and introduce yourselves
1. Consider what you need
    a. Quickly brainstorm a list of information you think you need to solve this problem.
    a. Examine your list and prioritize each item as either critical or supplemental to addressing this issue.
    a. Starting with your critical items, make a note next to each item of who or where you might be able to get this information from.
1. Identify sources
    a. How can you identify where the six hikers are located on a map?
    a. What might serve as a haven for a hiker in a wildfire?
    a. What might serve as an obstacle for a hiker?
    a. How can you show where fires, obstacles, and havens are located on a map?
    a. What resources did you use to find these answers?
1. Define the space
    a. Where can you find maps of your study area?
    a. What kind of maps do you need?
    a. Based on current maps of the region, what's there?
    a. Find maps of the current fires in the area. What are you using at "current" (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, or 7 days)?
    a. Do your best to draw or create a map that combines the fires and the hikers.
        - Where might some obstacles be located that impede a hiker's travel?
        - Where might some potential safe havens be located?
        - Based on your map, which hiker appears to be at the greatest risk?
1. Delegate tasks among your team
    - You don't have a lot of time to come up with your solution.
    - Decide who will be in charge of what tasks.
    - Take advantage of each other's strengths.
    - Pair up when possible.

**Questions to Answer**

1. Identify potential havens.
    - Come up with a list of locations where your hikers can seek shelter.
1. Identify potential obstructions.
    - Come up with a list of obstacles that hikers may need to avoid and reasoning for each.
1. What geolocation did you give the sixth hiker?
1. Determine the nearest haven for each hiker.

If you have time, please try to answer the following questions.

1. How should each hiker get to their haven?
1. How far and in what direction must they travel? Include an estimate of how long it might take them to get there.
1. What is the maximum elevation change they must travel over?

Include figures in your report

- area map of the locations of all six hikers over a basemap that shows topography
- locations of labeled potential havens proximal to each of the hikers; if possible, overlay your features with potential obstacles
    - for clarity, you may need to separate this into multiple figures
