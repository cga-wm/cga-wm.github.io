You are assigned multiple countries from which to choose to represent.

### Week 4
#### February 10, 2020

This week, we review the physics that drives mass wasting events (i.e., landslides).
We apply these core concepts to the factor of safety (FS) susceptibility index and link it with our susceptibility model.
We take a preliminary stab at finding data (and/or processes) to support the variables in our model.
We end the class with a skill-building challenge: finding the highest density of landslide occurrences in the United States.
