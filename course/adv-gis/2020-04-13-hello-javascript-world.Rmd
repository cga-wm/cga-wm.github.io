When considering how to design your feature classes for a given project, it is good to start with an example application.

In this post, let's take a look at the Hello, World introduction to JavaScript API ([link](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/quick-start/)).

The first step is to create a new text document (name it `index.html`) and copy-and-paste the example HTML (hypertext markup language) from Step 3.
For testing purposes, I will start a local HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) service using Python 3.
From the command line, navigate to the directory where you have your HTML file (using the `cd` command) and then run the following to evoke a simple Python-based HTTP server:

```
python -m http.server
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000)
```

Now, if you open a web browser and copy the URL above (e.g., http://0.0.0.0:8000 or http://localhost:8000), you should see a map similar to the image in the tutorial.

Continuing with the Quick Start, I went through the following tutorials:

1. [Create a starter app](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/create-a-starter-app/)
1. [Select a basemap](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/select-a-basemap/)
1. [Add layers to a map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/add-layers-to-a-map/)
1. [Style feature layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/style-feature-layers/)
1. [Configure pop-ups](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/javascript/configure-pop-ups/)
1. [Configure layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/arcgisonline/configure-layers/)

Important take-aways:

* Every hosted feature class has a unique REST (representational state transfer) service URL that we can use to access within our app (*i.e., we create a feature class, host it, share publicly, and grab the service URL*)

Here's my example: Hello, World ([html](2020-04-13-hello-world.html))
