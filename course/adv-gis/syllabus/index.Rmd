Course Description
==================

This course extends the existing base of GIS knowledge and skills by amplifying programmatic approaches to spatial data and analysis.
Lectures, labs, and projects emphasize GIS model development, spatial database architecture and design best practices, and extend knowledge of web GIS by authoring and consuming geographic web services.
Students will become familiar with methods of leveraging programming languages (such as Python) to make GIS processing easier, faster, and more accurate by scripting and automating data management, production, manipulation, and analysis procedures.
Activities develop GIS analysis skills with examples from government, social science, physical science, and the humanities.

Course Objectives
=================
1. Apply geospatial problem-solving tactics through individual and collaborative research, design and analysis to real-world challenges.
2. Define geoethics and evaluate it with regards to a real-world scenario.
3. Develop new learning, time management and data organization skills.
4. Demonstrate professional communication skills for reaching broad audiences.
5. Develop programming skills for geospatial applications.

_Note that there are also project-specific objectives, see Performance Accomplishments and/or Performance Review Worksheet._

What you should already know
----------------------------
* You should have a basic understanding of the main two geographic data models (vector and raster), including: what they represent; how these data models are created, stored, and edited; the pros and cons of these two data models; and how to open, manipulate and visualize them using a GIS.
* You should have a basic understanding of geographic coordinate systems, including: the main components of coordinate systems, how to perform projections and transformations of geographic data, and what it means to do so.
* You should have a basic understanding of the GIS project workflow, including: finding and creating spatial data; managing data files and their metadata; designing a workflow of geoprocesses to meet an intended goal; and visualizing spatial data (and/or products) in a meaningful way.

What is expected of you
-----------------------
* Develop advanced geospatial skills and techniques.
* Work collaboratively with your classmates and instructor to solve/address the course projects along with any "special works" that may come up.
* Maintain a log/report that outlines *everything* you do (including any research, development, analysis, and collaboration) and approximately how long it took you to do it.

    > The First Step Towards Effectiveness by Peter E. Drucker
    >
    > 1. Know thy time.

* Communicate with your classmates and instructor using remote/web-based technology (see **Communication** above)
* Schedule and meet with your instructor three times:
    1. Once during the first week to overview the Performance Review Worksheet and the expectations for the Performance Accomplishments;
    2. Once during or just following the third week to report on your progress; and
    3. Once at or near the end of the summer session for the oral evaluation of your performance accomplishments.
* Ask questions and make mistakes.
    If you are not feeling frustrated, then you are likely not invested in the class.
* Uphold professionalism in everything you do (see [**Code of Conduct**](#the-code-of-conduct) below).
* Provide a course evaluation at the end of the term with a summary of things you liked and disliked; methods that worked for you and those that fell short; topics that interested you and those that were uninteresting.

Course Structure
================

How this class is stylized
--------------------------
For the summer term, my goal is to mimic a real-world geospatial organization that hires summer interns to solve spatial problems.
I'm taking inspiration from Ben Balter's ["15 rules for communicating at GitHub"](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/).
This type of asynchronous workstyle is becoming more prevalent and economically gainful in today's tech world; not to mention the accelerated rate of remote work under the present pandemic.
Having the skills to work remotely and collaboratively can give you a "leg up" in the job market.
This course aims to pair style with content to give you a truly advanced geospatial programming and analysis experience.

Your goal is to work as a team to address (and potentially solve) the projects that are assigned.
There are a set number of core projects and each of the projects has certain necessary skills associated with it.
You choose how to address these projects (e.g., work on all of them at the same time or tackle one at a time).
You keep in constant communication with your classmates and instructor.

This style of learning closely resembles what will be expected of you following graduation and entering the workforce.
The difference here is that there is the expectation that you will help one another (not always the case in the real world) and your instructor will be your personal tutor and guide (a luxury, for certain).

**Disclaimer 1**: This class is a part of the Center for Geospatial Analysis's [Certificate in Geographic Information Science Program](https://www.wm.edu/as/cga/certificate/overview/index.php) and is offered to post-baccalaureate level students.
Undergraduates at William & Mary also have the opportunity to take this course with slightly modified expectations during evaluation.

**Disclaimer 2**: In academia, it is well known that new courses take about 3--4 iterations before they are "well developed."
That being said, this class is currently in "beta" version (i.e., second interation); therefore, two things apply: 1) class structure, methods, topics, delivery, evaluation, etc. are in a constant state of change so please be patient; 2) you are in a position to alter the course by providing feedback, so please, open a notebook and jot down your thoughts, opinions and concerns regarding the class as we go along and use this to craft your course evaluation at the end of the term.

How class time is used
----------------------
This is an advanced class aimed at introducing several new concepts, software, tools, methods, and analyses in a rather short time.
It is strongly suggested (and even required) that you take advantage of one another and the instructor to maximum what can be done and what you can learn during this time.

Remember, your goal is to complete the Performance Accomplishments before the end of term.
To do so, you need to demonstrate that you have satisfied the learning objectives defined in the Performance Review Worksheet.


How this class is assessed
--------------------------
_This class is assessed based on a written/oral evaluation of student learning._

At the beginning of the semester, students will be assigned learning objectives along with the minimum requirements for meeting the course's expectations in what is called the **Performance Review Worksheet**.
In the first video conference meeting with the instructor, students will review the criteria for meeting the expectations for the class and make any adjustments necessary with their instructor.
The Performance Review Worksheet should not be edited again until the final evaluation.

During the term, students will keep track of their work that addresses each of the course's expectations in the form of a written document called **Performance Accomplishments**, noting such things as what they did, how they did it, how long it took them, and what they gained from it.
Additional materials or documentation may be linked to within the Performance Accomplishments document or added to the shared Drive folder.

Near the middle of the term, students will have their second video conference meeting with their instructor to review their progress and make certain everything is on schedule for the end of term.
Under special circumstances, adjustments may be made to the Performance Review Worksheet, which is authorized only by the instructor.

At the end of the term, students will have their third video conference meeting with the instructor to go over their individual Performance Accomplishments.
The instructor may critique each element identified by the student.
Students may be asked to further demonstrate their skills.

The criteria for each accomplishment is defined in the Performance Review worksheet and will, in general, receive an evaluation of one of the following qualities.

Based on the cumulative assessment of individual accomplishments, a student will earn the corresponding grade for their level of achievement.

Qualitative Assessment | Approximate Grade
:--- | :---
Unsatisfactory | F
Does Not Meet Expectations | C--, D+, or D
Fully Meets Expectations | B, B--, C+, or C
Exceeds Expectations | A, A--, or B+

The following stipulations impact a student's final grade.

* The instructor reserves the right to adjust a student's final evaluation score by at most one-half step (e.g., in a plus/minus scale, a C may be rewarded to a C+ or downgraded to a C--) so long as it does not conflict with the following two rules.
* A student cannot receive a final grade higher than Fully Meets Expectations (C) if one or more of their individual accomplishments receives an Unsatisfactory evaluation score.
* A student cannot receive a final grade less than Does Not Meet Expectations (D) if none of their individual accomplishments receive an Unsatisfactory score.

There are no points, bonuses or extra credit assignments in this class.

# Course Topics

## Project A - Shark Attacks

### Overview
A client has asked whether shark attacks are predictable or perhaps coincident with some environmental or other measurable factors.
Their interest stems from the growing number of shark deaths caused by the hands of humans (mostly) in response to misinformation regarding human-shark relations.
As shark numbers decrease, the ethical implications of our management of their species becomes more relevant.

### Learning Objectives
1. Define geoethics and provide an example of a "myth" regarding human-shark relations.
2. Identify, find, evaluate and organize relevant spatial data and perform necessary processes to integrate them into a single GIS workflow.
3. Design a GIS project workflow that identifies the key information and synthesize them for addressing a spatial relationship between shark attacks and one or more external/environmental factors.
4. Communicate your methods with your colleagues and assess and critique your process and/or results based on student and instructor feedback.
5. Recognize the multidisciplinary roles of GIS in real-world applications.


## Project B - Electioneering

### Overview
A client has asked whether electioneering is creating an unfair bias in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.
They are interested in the ethical implications behind any spatial factors---such as polling locations and districting---that may lead to party-specific advantage.

### Learning Objectives
1. Define electioneering and provide an example of a potential geoethical debate associated with it.
2. Identify, find, evaluate and organize relevant spatial data and perform necessary processes to integrate them into a single GIS workflow.
3. Design a GIS project workflow that identifies the key information and synthesize them for addressing a particular aspect of electioneering.
4. Communicate your methods with your colleagues and assess and critique your process and/or results based on student and instructor feedback.
5. Recognize the multidisciplinary roles of GIS in real-world applications.


## Project C - Geofencing

### Overview
A client has asked for a web-based application that interacts with a user's location to tell a story.
They have purposefully been vague to see the different types and varieties of ideas.
They want to have a storyboard (conceptual design), a sequence diagram (application design) and potentially a working prototype of the app.
You have been advised to utilize the concept of __geofencing__.

### Learning Objectives
1. Define geofencing, explain how it is used across multiple disciplines, and give an example of a geoethical debate associated with it.
2. Design a geospatial database to meet a web-based application.
3. Perform a field-based geospatial survey.
4. Design a storyboard that has spatial dependency.
5. Construct a web-based application that utilizes geofencing.

Standards & Policies
====================

The Code of Conduct
-------------------
By the basis in which this class is designed, these things hold true:

1. This class utilizes several forms of communication (e.g., instant messaging, discussion boards, wikis, emails, audio/video conferencing), of which not all can be monitored by the instructor at all times.
2. You are responsible for how you interact with each other.

Remember these things as you work together:

1. "Don't ascribe maliciousness to that which can be explained by inadvertence."

    This comes from the fact that it is almost impossible to portray our feelings or intended meaning behind typed text.
    If something offends you, take a breath, be cordial and ask for clarification before unleashing your wrath (BTW: you shouldn't unleash your wrath).
    That being said, also do not be a silent witness.
    If something offends you, let everyone know.
    We will never learn from our mistakes if they are not pointed out.
    If malicious actions continue, the instructor will manage it.
2. "There is no innovation and creativity without failure. Period."

    You are a college student registered in a college class.
    You are not expected to know everything.
    The entire purpose of this exercise is for you to gain knowledge, so make an effort.
    If you want to try something, try it and let everyone know what you are up to.
    Best case scenario, your innovations spark new insight.
    Worst case scenario, we all learn something from your efforts.
    Remember: there are not right answers to these projects---just creative approaches, innovative designs and happy accidents---so don't be afraid to make a mistake.
    It's better to aim high for something that will make a difference rather than to play it safe with something easy.
3. Ask lots of questions.

    Questions are cheap, so ask a lot of them.
    Remember to always strive for clarity.
    If you don't know something or your aren't sure, then ask.
4. Focus on opportunities.

    Remember: this is not a race and you are not a judge, so don't get caught up with critiquing or competing with others.
    Provide your opinions and perspectives and then actually take the time to read the opinions and perspectives of others.
    Challenge yourself to see things differently and try things differently.
    Ignore your desire to be correct or to correct someone else and try not to contradict people; they don't like it and biologically it shuts down their ability to see things logically.
5. Document and share everything.

    While it may feel natural to keep your work private, projects really thrive when you document your process publicly.
    By writing things down and sharing them, more people can participate along the way and you might get help on something you didn't even know you needed.
    This leads to more things being documented, which produces a better project roadmap, which leads to better transparency and feedback, which leads to good decision making and faster/better results.
6. Everyone is bound to uphold a policy of respect for their instructor and their peers.
    Students should be open-minded to new ideas and participate in collegiate debate, the sharing of ideas, and the receiving of feedback without defamatory remarks.
    Students should help maintain a healthy learning environment by refraining from negative behavior, such as harmful remarks, quibbling over trivial matters, creating unnecessary debates, or bullying.

    **There is zero tolerance for negative behavior. Failure to uphold this policy will result in punitive action and/or removing the offending student from access to all or part of the class.**


Engagement Policy
-----------------
- *Weekly virtual engagement is expected.*

In this asynchronous virtual classroom, engagement is defined loosely as your interaction with one or more of the web-based communication tools.

It is expected that you interact at a minimum with the posted discussions, chats, issues, emails, and/or video conferencing once a week.
Failure to do so may influence your final grade.

Please make any and all planned absences (e.g., field trips, vacations, athletic events) that would result in you not being able to meet this minimum interaction known to your instructor at the earliest possible time.


Coursework Policy
-----------------
- *You are bound by the honor code.*

By accepting admission to the College, you have made a commitment to understand, support, and abide by the [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/honor).
**Violations, whether attempted or successful, will result in consequences ranging from a verbal reprimand up to a failing grade for the class**.

Misconduct may include, but is not limited to, the following:

- cheating or using unauthorized materials on assignments
- fabrication, forgery, alteration, or destruction of documents; hacking unauthorized resources; intimidating or bribing peers; improper collaboration or colluding; plagiarizing; or lying in order to obtain academic advantage
- assisting others in misconduct
- attempting misconduct


Email Policy
------------
- *All class-related correspondence should be made to the instructor's W&M email address ([see above](#course-syllabus)) and include the class title in the subject line.*

For private inquiries, please email the instructor; the instructor will confirm each email received.
If you do not receive a confirmation message from the instructor within 12 hours of sending, feel free to send a follow-up email.


Make-Up Policy
--------------
- *There are no make-ups.*

Evaluation dates should be suggested by the student and approved by the instructor.
If, for some reason, you are unable to meet during the scheduled time or turn in your performance accomplishments on time, you may email the professor before the regularly scheduled evaluation date to reschedule it at a mutually convenient time or else receive an unsatisfactory scoring.
Under rare circumstance, students may request an incomplete; the acceptance of which is at the sole discretion of the instructor.


Standards for Written Work
