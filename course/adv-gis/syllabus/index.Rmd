Course Description
==================

This course extends the existing base of GIS knowledge and skills by amplifying programmatic approaches to spatial data and analysis.
Lectures, labs, and projects emphasize GIS model development, develop spatial database architecture and design best practices, and extend knowledge of web GIS by authoring and consuming geographic web services.
Students will become familiar with methods of leveraging programming languages (such as Python) to make GIS processing easier, faster, and more accurate by scripting and automating data management, production, manipulation, and analysis procedures.
Activities develop GIS analysis skills with examples from government, social science, physical science, and the humanities.

Technology

:   - Announcements, discussions, course calendar, etc., will be related to you through the university's [Blackboard](https://blackboard.wm.edu); please make certain you have access to it.
    - Scripting assignments will be tested and graded using [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/) or later.

        \* _Note that both ArcGIS Pro and QGIS Desktop come with their own versions of Python 3 that satisfy this requirement._

    - Geographic visualizations and analysis will be handled using either of the latest stable releases or the university's current installed versions of Esri's [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/resources) and/or [QGIS Desktop](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/).

        \* _Both ArcGIS Pro and QGIS are available at most campus computer labs (see [here](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/computerlabs/locations/index.php) for locations). ArcGIS Pro may be installed on individual laptops for Microsoft Windows users only. QGIS may be downloaded and installed on all major OS's._

        \*\* _Note that there is no 'all-in-one' problem-solving software. Software is a tool. You may be required to use alternative software to complete certain tasks._

    - Communication and documentation will be reported to the public using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

        \* _You will need to create a GitHub account, if you do not already have one._

Course Objectives
=================
1. Apply geospatial problem-solving tactics through individual and collaborative research, design, and analysis to real-world challenges.
2. Define geoethics and evaluate it with regards to a real-world scenario.
3. Develop new learning, time management, and data organization skills.
4. Demonstrate professional communication skills for reaching broad audiences.

What you should already know
----------------------------
* You should have a basic understanding of the main two geographic data models (vector and raster), including: what they represent; how these data models are created, stored, and edited; the pros and cons of these two data models; and how to open, manipulate and visualize them using a GIS.
* You should have a basic understanding of geographic coordinate systems, including: the main components of coordinate systems, how to perform projections and transformations of geographic data, and what it means to do so.
* You should have a basic understanding of the GIS project workflow, including: finding and creating spatial data; managing data files and their metadata; designing a workflow of geoprocesses to meet an intended goal; and visualizing spatial data in a meaningful way.


Course Structure
================

How this class is organized
---------------------------
_This class focuses on two major topics to be covered roughly by half a semester each._

Both topics include a real-world challenge to be researched, analyzed, and addressed by the class (either individually or in groups); there will also be skill-building activities and assignments to supplement and complement the learning objectives.

At the end of each topic, there will be key deliverables accompanied by an evaluation and demonstration/discussion.

How class time is used
----------------------
_This class meets for one three-hour long session per week._

The session may be broken up into discussions or in-class assignments, activities, or challenge questions; however, the majority of the time will be spent working on solving the two the main challenge topics.

As an advanced class, it is expected that you can and will do much of the legwork on your own.

How this class is assessed
--------------------------
_This class is assessed based on a two-step evaluation of student learning._

At the beginning of the semester and again at (or near) the midterm, students will be assigned a learning objective evaluation form for the current topic.
During each half-semester, students will complete the Performance Accomplishments form, noting such things as what they did, how they did it, how long it took them, and what they gained from it.

At midterm (and again at the end of the semester), students will meet with the instructor to go over their individual Performance Accomplishments.
The instructor may critique each element identified by the student.
Students may be asked to further demonstrate their skills.

The criteria for each accomplishment is defined in the Performance Review worksheet and will, in general, receive an evaluation of one of the following qualities.

Based on the cumulative assessment of individual accomplishments, a student will earn the corresponding grade for their level of achievement.

Qualitative Assessment | Approximate Grade
:--- | :---
Unsatisfactory | F
Does Not Meet Expectations | C--, D+, or D
Fully Meets Expectations | B, B--, C+, or C
Exceeds Expectations | B+, A--, or A

The following stipulations can impact a student's final grade.

* The instructor reserves the right to adjust a student's final evaluation score by at most one-half step of a grade (e.g., in a plus/minus scale, a C may be rewarded to a C+ or downgraded to a C--) so long as it does not conflict with the following two rules.
* A student cannot receive higher than Fully Meets Expectations (C) for the semester if one or more of their individual accomplishments receives an Unsatisfactory evaluation score.
* A student cannot receive less than Does Not Meet Expectations (D) for the semester if none of their individual accomplishments receive an Unsatisfactory score.


# Course Topics

## Natural Disasters

### Overview
This semester, the main focus for the natural disasters topic is __landslides__.
Landslides may occur in every country of the world and impact every aspect of the human condition from public health; property value, taxes, and insurance; government spending, national aid, and political agendas; ethics, economics and social inequality; to hazard identification, mitigation, science and research.

You (the class) will form "pop-up" consultant firms for landslide hazard assessment and tackle randomly assigned countries.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how GIS is used in natural hazard assessment, planning, and management.
2. Gain a deeper understanding of the multidisciplinary roles of GIS in real-world applications.
3. Become aware of geoethics and be able to identify ethical challenges within the geosciences.
4. Develop programming skills for geospatial applications.
5. Develop advanced geoprocessing skills and be able to apply them to a real-world application.

## GIS Web Applications

### Overview
This semester, the main focus for the web applications topic is __geofencing__.
Geofencing is a relatively underrepresented topic in geosciences and almost unheard of by the general public; however, you can find geofencing applications across several disciplines being utilized both for and against you in your daily life!

### Learning Objectives
1. Define geofencing and explain how it is used across multiple disciplines.
2. Design a geospatial database to meet a web-hosted application.
3. Perform a field-based geospatial survey.
4. Develop programming skills for geospatial applications.
5. Design a web-based application that utilizes geofencing.

All in attendance are bound to uphold a policy of respect for their instructor and their peers.
Students should be open-minded to new ideas and participate in collegiate debate without defamatory remarks.

--------------
- *There are no make-ups.*
