summary: "More stabs at Esri's developers API for creating geofencing application."

A few things worked that I worked out this week:

1. The `require` statement that precedes the Javascript in Esri's examples is actually a part of Node.js, which explains the need for `outFields` within module-defined objects
1. You can move all the stuff out of the index.html file and into its own script file (e.g., `geofence.js`) and call the script by adding the following line at the end of your head tag.
    I've found this to be easier to work with, especially in CodePen.io.

    ```
    <script src="./geofence.js"></script>
    ```

Currently stuck on Geolocation object returned by the locate event trigger.
