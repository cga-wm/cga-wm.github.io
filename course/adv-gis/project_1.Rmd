> Design/develop a Python-based ArcGIS Toolbox for analyzing landslide susceptibility.

- Performance Review Worksheet ([.docx][prwdocx]) ([.gdoc][prwgdoc])
- Performance Accomplishments ([.docx][padocx]) ([.gdoc][pagdoc])

Landslides may occur in every country of the world and impact every aspect of the human condition from public health; property value, taxes, and insurance; government spending, national aid, and political agendas; ethics, economics and social inequality; to hazard identification, mitigation, science and research.

In this first scenario, you work for an organization that has tasked you, the GIS experts, to sort out landslide susceptibility for several international clients.

You, members of our organization, will break into teams (undergrads in teams of 2--3 and graduates/certificate students as individuals or pairs) and will be assigned international clients (chosen at random, see [the Python script (.py)](scripts/random_country_generator.py)).
Your team will create its own consultant firm (with a name, slogan, logo, etc.) and have a web presence (e.g., using GitHub Pages) to communicate your tasks and accomplishments to your organization's management and the clients.

## The Susceptibility Model
The Critical Rainfall Threshold Model (Eq. 28, [Iverson, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900090)).

```
     tan φ       C - ψt * γw * (tan φ)
Fs = -----  +  --------------------------
     tan θ     γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)
```

where:

- Fs is the factor of safety
- φ is internal angle of friction (deg)
- θ is hillslope (deg)
- C is soil cohesion (Pa = kg/m/s^2)
- ψt is pressure head (m) = h * cosθ (Eq. 6, [Gabet et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.03.011))
- γw is unit weight of water (N/m^3); N=kg*m/s^2
- γr is unit weight of soil regolith (N/m^3)
- H is soil regolith thickness (m)
