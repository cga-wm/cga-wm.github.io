- Performance Accomplishments ([.docx][padocx]) ([.gdoc][pagdoc])

Landslides may occur in every country of the world and impact every aspect of the human condition from public health; property value, taxes, and insurance; government spending, national aid, and political agendas; ethics, economics and social inequality; to hazard identification, mitigation, science and research.

In this first scenario, you work for an organization that has tasked you, the GIS experts, to sort out landslide susceptibility for several international clients.

You, members of our organization, will break into teams (undergrads in teams of 2--3 and graduates/certificate students as individuals or pairs) and will be assigned international clients (chosen at random, see [the Python script (.py)](scripts/random_country_generator.py)).
Your team will create its own consultant firm (with a name, slogan, logo, etc.) and have a web presence (e.g., using GitHub Pages) to communicate your tasks and accomplishments to your organization's management and the clients.

## The Susceptibility Model
The Critical Rainfall Threshold Model (Eq. 28, [Iverson, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900090)).

```
     tan φ       C - ψt * γw * (tan φ)
Fs = -----  +  --------------------------
     tan θ     γr * H * (sin θ) * (cos θ)
```

where:

- Fs is the factor of safety
- φ is internal angle of friction (deg)
- θ is hillslope (deg)
- C is soil cohesion (Pa = kg/m/s^2)
- ψt is pressure head (m) = h * cosθ (Eq. 6, [Gabet et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2004.03.011))
- γw is unit weight of water (N/m^3); N=kg*m/s^2
- γr is unit weight of soil regolith (N/m^3)
- H is soil regolith thickness (m)

## Example Project Outline

1. Select a city or town from one of your assigned countries
1. Create a base map of your town/city
    - Include information relevant to hazard analysis (e.g., properties, roads, utilities, and other critical infrastructure); consider what information you include and what information you exclude (candidate for your ethics discussion)
    - Create new spatial data (e.g., geocoding, georeferencing); this is candidate for your 'how-to'
1. Find elevation data for your study area
    - do a little research to determine whether your elevation data is a DEM, DTM, or DSM
    - try examining more than one DEM for your study region and analyze their differences; which is the better candidate and why?
    - calculate slopes based on elevation
1. Find soil maps of your study region; you may have to go to the library for paper versions if online maps are not available (luckily, the library is conveniently located)
    - rasterize soil maps (if necessary)
    - classify soil maps for cohesion and friction angle values; this may end up being a raster of one value for the whole study area
1. Research soil depth and average to maximum rainfall events for your study area; use these values in your susceptibility model
1. Assemble a geoprocessing workflow (e.g., model builder, python script, or toolbox) for the susceptibility model given above; another candidate for your 'how-to'
1. Overlay susceptibility with your base map to identify at-risk infrastructure
1. Simulate a landslide by artificially increasing the land surface elevation in areas of susceptibility to emphasize risk to your client
1. Repeat for any additional cities you have time for

**Case Study: Collbran, Colorado**

1. Decide on a CRS (e.g., NAD83 UTM 13N; datum matches DEM and is recommended by CDOT)
1. Download digital elevation data (e.g., [The National Map](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/))
1. Project raster
1. Add your city to the map by creating a plain text file (e.g., point.txt), creating an XY Point table (such as the one below), and importing to GIS

    ```
    ID,LAT,LON,CITY,STATE
    0,39.240016,-107.963956,Collbran,CO
    ```
1. Project point
1. Extract DEM by mask (e.g., buffer or poly)
    - Note: had to use Cell Statistics to knit together two DEM tiles
1. Calculate slope
1. Download soil data (e.g., STATSGO2)
    - Note: use MUKEY (map unit key) to determine MUSYM (map unit symbol)
