## Shark Attack

Questions have arisen regarding the geoethics associated with sharks.
Your goal is to find factual information in support of or debunking myths about shark attacks.

For this project, you will keep an ArcGIS Notebook [(pdf)](https://community.esri.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/13764-102-3-22953/agol_notebooks.pdf) of your findings and analyses.
You will save/export your notebook as an HTML document to be shared across the web with your client.
In order to accomplish this task, you will need to learn [Markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb) and Python scripting in a Jupyter notebook style setting, for which this class will prepare you.
