Designs and implements a means for storing relevant project input/output data and geoprocessing layers, prescribing their necessary metadata including data source, author/maintainer, creation date, scale, and scope of use (<em>data organization</em>). The choice of data organization method should be based on best practices for the field or domain science.</p></li>
